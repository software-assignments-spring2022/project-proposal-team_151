# Project Proposal

### Project title
MentorMe

### What and why?
MentorMe is a platform on which students are able to give ratings and comments on their academic advisors and find other student mentors for career advisement. A student can be paired with another student to get advice on courses, career opportunities, research opportunities, and other resources.

The reason why we want to create this platform is that we feel lack of advisement opportunies when we were in freshman or sophomore years. We missed career opportunies due to lack of insights and had limited resources to find someone more experienced to consult with. And once we grew more experienced, we feel difficult to help younger students reach their goals because there isn't a systematic way to offer resources and advice to those in need. For the advisor-rating functionality, we notice that many college students had unpleasant times working with their academic advisors, so we would like to create a rateMyProfessor-like platform for those who want to share their comments and ratings for their advisors.

### For whom?
The MentorMe platform is designed for students who have questions about their learning journey and career path and want to seek consultations from peers who are on similar paths. In short, two sides of our users are the ones who have answers and the ones who have questions. 

Therefore, some sample user stories would be:

"As a freshman, international, drama student, I want to know how to prepare and accumulate my materials so that I could get a role in broadway productions one day."

"As a senior computer science student, I want to provide experience about my past internship so that those who're interested in the same kind of career would have a better understanding of how to plan their study."


### How?
The platform will be based on user profiles, communications, and communities. Users will be split into mentors and advisees. Advisees will be able to search for mentors based on the experiences, schools, and classes they've taken, and they can chat with mentors one on one. At the end of the conversation, advisees can rate the mentors and the ratings will show on the mentor's profile. 

A side function will be a rating board of existing advisors from the school, just like rateMyProfessor.


### Scope
4-6 developers are able to finish this platform in a semester. 2-3 developers can work on the front-end side because both two main functionalities require extensive front-end development, such as building rating and comment-displaying pages and pages for students to match, select, and chat. Other developers can work on the back-end side implementing the features of the app. Building match and chat functionalities can be a bit challenging, so 4 developers working on the back-end should be suitable. Moreover, a semester can be divided into two halves, dedicated to advisor-rating and mentor-matching respectively.
