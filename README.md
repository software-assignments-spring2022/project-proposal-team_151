# Project Proposal

### Project title
MentorMe

### What and why?
MentorMe is a platform on which students are able to give ratings and comments on their academic advisors and find other student mentors for career advisement. A student can be paired with another student to get advice on courses, career opportunities, research opportunities, and other resources.

The reason why we want to create this platform is that we feel lack of advisement opportunies when we were in freshman or sophomore years. We missed career opportunies due to lack of insights and had limited resources to find someone more experienced to consult with. And once we grew more experienced, we feel difficult to help younger students reach their goals because there isn't a systematic way to offer resources and advice to those in need. For the advisor-rating functionality, we notice that many college students had unpleasant times working with their academic advisors, so we would like to create a rateMyProfessor-like platform for those who want to share their comments and ratings for their advisors.

### For whom?


### How?


### Scope
4-6 developers are able to finish this platform in a semester. 2-3 developers can work on the front-end side because both two main functionalities require extensive front-end development, such as building rating and comment-displaying pages and pages for students to match, select, and chat. Other developers can work on the back-end side implementing the features of the app. Building match and chat functionalities can be a bit challenging, so 4 developers working on the back-end should be suitable. Moreover, a semester can be divided into two halves, dedicated to advisor-rating and mentor-matching respectively.
